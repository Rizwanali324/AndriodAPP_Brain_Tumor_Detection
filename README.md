# Brain Tumor Detection Project

This project aims to classify brain MRI images into one of the following categories:
- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**

## Overview

The model is trained using a dataset of MRI images to automatically detect and classify brain tumors. This project involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve accurate classification of the different tumor types.

## Tumor Types

1. **Glioma Tumor**: A type of tumor that occurs in the brain and spinal cord.
2. **Meningioma Tumor**: A tumor that forms on the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.
3. **No Tumor**: Indicates that no abnormality or tumor is detected in the MRI scan.
4. **Pituitary Tumor**: A growth or tumor on the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain.
